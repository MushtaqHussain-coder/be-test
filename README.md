# 🧪 Backend test

This project is targeted as a test task and contais a small project that has a database and a backend. There are tasks listed below that are subject to be solved. This assignent is aimed to test some basic programming knowledge and experience with `git`.

The project uses the following:

-   Docker to run services in containers
-   Postgresql as the database
-   Prisma as ORM
-   A backend written in NodeJS exposing a simple API
-   JWT for basic authentication

There's instructions on how to start the service in the `🚀 Start services` section.

## 🧾 Tasks

-   Describe the roles of `docker`, `postgres`, `prisma` and `express` for the project.
-   Implement the `/users/invalidateToken/:id` endpoint. The endpoint should invalidate the JWT that is associated with the user of id `id`.
-   Add a many-to-many relationship between users and company. [Hint.](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations)
    -   Add so that when calling `/users` the company data linked to the user is also retuned.
-   **Bonus 🚨:** There is a security vulnerability in one of the `users` endpoints (Disrecarding the very busted login endpoint). If you can find it - describe the issue and patch the vulnerability.

## 🏁 Submitting the test

1. Fork this repository
2. Solve as many tasks as you can and commit them in a fitting manner
3. Upload the forked repository and
4. Share the repository with us by either making it public and send us the repository link _or_ inviting us to the forked project.

# 🚀 Start services

## 📍Prerequisits

-   Docker with docker-compose installed
-   node installed (Dockerfile runs node 18)
-   Install all node modules with `npm i`

## Copy .env_example file
Copy env file using `cp .env_example .env`. `.env` is gitignored.

## 💾 Run database

Start the Postgres database by starting the single docker service.

```
docker-compose up -d db
```

## 🌱 Run database migration

To get the database up and running, we need to populate the database with the prisma schema.

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name <MY_MIGRARTION_NAME>
```

Replace `<MY_MIGRARTION_NAME>` with something fitting. Initial migrations can be named `initial_migration`.

## 🏃‍♀️ Run backend

To get the backend up and running simply start the node server:

```
node index.js
```

## 🔥 OPTIONAL: Run docker-compose

Granted that the migration has been run, you can run docker-compose to start the services:

```
docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build -d
```
